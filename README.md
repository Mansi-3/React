# React Component Naming Conventions

React component names must always start with a capital letter. This is how you know it's a React component. In contrast, HTML tags must be written in lowercase.

## Example

Here is an example of a React component:

```javascript
// This is a React component
function MyButton() {
  return <button>Click me</button>;
}

export default MyButton;
